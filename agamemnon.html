Starting to program a game can be quite an intimidating task, it's easy to get carried away and daunted by the huge amount of work required. Even in a simple text-based adventure game, it was easy to succumb to scope creep and become overwhelmed turning an enjoyable task into a stressful one. However, by using some simple planning tools I learnt along the way was able to remain in scope and focused on the task at hand. In this article, I will explain the methods and tools that I used to overcome these issues in the hopes that I will save you the headache.</p>

            <p><br>First and foremost, creating a clear scope including what is in and what is out of scope. For example, in scope for my project was a health point tracking system out of scope was graphical rendering of the game. While very simple it is important to get a clear understanding of the task you are trying to achieve and what functions are not required. Scopes can change over the course of your project but by having this as a strong foundation it becomes easier to complete sections of the project and feel like you are making progress without wasting time on distractions.<br><br><br></p>
            <p>Leading to... Point two code plans. While potentially not the most riveting part of the project they are perhaps the most important. While the benefits may be obvious when working in a team such as communication code plans are also extremely useful for a solo developer helping you to solve the logic problems of your program before implementing code. During the start of my development of Agamemnon's Goblet, I often ran into issues in the code logic causing me to find workarounds finally rewriting the core programs entirely after taking a step back and creating flow charts for my code. Not using effective code plans at the beginning cost me a lot of long nights and coffee but the lesson was learnt.<br><br></p>

            <p>
            Finally point three-unit testing. While potentially even less glamorous than code plans unit testing or testing each tiny part of your code in isolation is imperative to ensure that your code will work as intended in all (or as many) circumstances as possible. Without unit testing mistakes in the code can and will be compounded causing frustration. Unit testing has the added benefit of helping to make your code modular potentially helping you to create your own function library. </p>
